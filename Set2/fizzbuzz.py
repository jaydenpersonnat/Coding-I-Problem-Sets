                          # Fizzbuzz

"""
Background: 
FizzBuzz is a classic tech interview question. 
Your objective is to print out all the numbers from 1 to 100, but for numbers 
that are divisible by 3 you should print "Fizz" instead, and for numbers that 
are divisible by 5 you should print "Buzz" instead. For any number divisible 
by both 3 and 5 you should print "FizzBuzz".


Hereâ€™s what the first 15 lines of output should look like: 
    1
    2
    Fizz
    4
    Buzz
    Fizz
    7
    8
    Fizz
    Buzz
    11
    Fizz
    13
    14
    FizzBuzz

Roadmap: 
    1. Print the numbers 1 to 100 
    2. Print "Fizz" on multiples of 3 
    3. Finish by adding printing of "Buzz" and "Fizzbuzz" 

Testing
    Once you finish, run your code to make sure it works correctly.

    1. Does the beginning of the output match the example above?
    2. Does the end of the output look like this?
        Buzz
        Fizz
        97
        98
        Fizz
        Buzz
